The adventures of a bored physicist.

The idea behind this repository is to build robust, reusable computational tooling for
working with mathematical machinery. To test and document the objects defined within,
solutions to problems posed in a number of textbooks are presented.

Textbooks covered:

Bressoud - "A radical approach to real analysis"
